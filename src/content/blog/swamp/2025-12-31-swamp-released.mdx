Happy New Year's Eve! 🎆

As we say goodbye to 2025, I am excited to share one final release with you to kickstart your new year with a new software project.

The wait is over! After hundreds of hours of development, I’m thrilled to announce the release of Swamp!

This new server software allows you to play multiplayer games in Setonix, the customizable card and board game platform or work together in Butterfly, the cross platform note-taking app. Swamp is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and easy to set up.

The full protocol is open and documented, making it easy for developers to create their own clients or integrate with existing applications. Swamp is designed as room based server software, allowing simple and flexible multiplayer experiences. Butterfly and Setonix both use Swamp with end-to-end encryption to ensure your data stays private and secure, even the server operator can’t read your notes or game data.

You can find the source code and documentation on [GitHub](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Swamp). Please check out the [Swamp documentation](https://swamp.linwood.dev) for setup instructions and more information.

The server is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux (both x86_64 and ARM architectures) or on Docker.

I hope you enjoy using Swamp as much as I enjoyed building it. Here's to a fantastic 2026 filled with creativity and fun! Happy New Year! 🥂

Please report any issues on GitHub and share the project to help it grow!
