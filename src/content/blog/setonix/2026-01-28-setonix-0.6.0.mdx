## Lua scripting support for server \{#lua-scripting\}

The server now supports Lua scripting! This allows for more dynamic and interactive servers.
This includes support for game modes in packs, a scripts directory, and a new blackjack sample game mode to demonstrate the capabilities.

Documentation for scripting will be made available soon on the Setonix documentation site, for now feel free to explore the sample game mode and experiment with your own scripts.

Additionally the server now looks at the scripts directory in the server data folder to load custom luau scripts.

## Waypoints \{#waypoints\}

Waypoints have been added to help navigate the world more easily. These waypoints can be specified to be public or team only.

These new waypoints also can be used to add teleportation on the server.

## Action buttons support \{#action-buttons\}

If you have server game modes, you can now add action buttons that will be displayed as a play icon button in the top right corner of the screen.
If a user presses the button, an action will be sent to the server to handle.

## Dialog improvements \{#dialog-improvements\}

Dialogs have been enhanced with new components. You can now use checkboxes and dropdowns in dialogs, allowing for more complex inputs and interactions.

## Better chat message display \{#chat-display\}

The chat interface has been improved to show now the user name of the message author, making it easier to follow conversations.

## Server-based toolbar options \{#toolbar-options\}

Toolbar options can now be managed from the server side, giving administrators more control over the user experience.
For example on blackjack, you can now disable the edit mode from the server so users cannot summon cards.
