After a year of planning and a few months of coding, I’m excited to announce the first release of Setonix!

Setonix is a new way to play card and board games with friends, no matter where they are, and even if you don’t have an internet connection. You can play it on your phone, tablet, or computer.

The game is build with customizability in mind. You can create your own cards and boards, and even host your own servers. It’s open-source and free to use.

The main game doesn’t have any set rules—you can place cards anywhere on an infinite board, just like Linwood Butterfly. You can also play other games, like chess, and share your game table with others.

You can read more about the concept [here](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Setonix/discussions/26).

Current limitations are:

* The protocol is not stable and will change
  * This means you need to have the same version of the client and server
* Missing checks on server
  * Make sure you only allow trusted people to connect
* No rules are implemented yet
  * You can only play without rules (in singleplayer)
  * You can still implement rules by using the server as a library (read more in the documentation)
  * Will be added in later versions
* Missing error messages
  * Some errors are not displayed, so you might not know what went wrong

Currently, the game is in 0.1 version and I'm currently working on making the app available on the app stores. You can download the game [from the download page on the website](https://setonix.world/downloads).

Please share this with your friends and report any bugs you find. I hope you enjoy the game as much as I do!
