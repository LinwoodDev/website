After a while, here is a new version of Setonix!

Highlights:

* üì¶ Packs editor
* üñ•Ô∏è Binary changes (New linux arm, min Android version 6.0)
* üêû Bug fixes

## Packs editor

There is now a new packs editor to create your packs inside the app. This should make it easier to extend the game with your own packs.

Please give feedback on the new editor.

## Binary changes

Like on butterfly the binaries have changed.

There is a new linux arm build available for testing. Please report any issues.

Additionally the minimum version of android has been changed to 6.0 (Marshmallow) instead of 5.0 (Lollipop).

## Notes

I'm currently working on a new plugin system for Setonix. It will use luau (Roblox lua) under the hood. This will add the option to program rules for the game both on singleplayer and multiplayer.

Stay tuned for more information. Feel free to give feedback.
