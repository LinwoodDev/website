## Account System

The new account system works decentralized with asymmetric encryption. This means that if you join a server, you can create an account that is stored locally on your device. This allows you to have a unique identity on the server without needing to rely on a central server for authentication.

## Authentication System

With the new account system you can now authenticate yourself on the server. On joining a server, you will be prompted to select an account. The authentication will work completely automatically.

## Loading Screen

When joining a server, you will now see a loading screen. This is useful for servers that take a while to load, as it gives you feedback that the game is loading.

## Server List

There is now an official server list. Currently it is empty, but you can request to have your server listed. This will allow players to easily find and join servers.

## Kick Message

When you are kicked from a server, you will now see a message explaining why you were kicked. This is useful for understanding why you were removed from the server.

## Notes

Please note that this is application is still unstable and is not recommended for production use. Feel free to report any issues you find.
