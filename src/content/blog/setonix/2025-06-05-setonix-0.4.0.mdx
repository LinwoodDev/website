## Multiplayer improvements

The multiplayer UI has been improved to make it easier to use. The game now supports swamp multiplayer, allowing you to play with friends in a more dynamic environment. Butterfly and Setonix are now fully compatible with the new swamp multiplayer system which will be released soon.
Read more about Swamp [here](https://swamp.linwood.dev/docs/v1/intro).
Additionally server can now send link information to the client, allowing you to join games more easily.

A launch app link has been added for Android, making it easier to join games directly from the app.

## Stacked cards

Cards can now be stacked on top of each other, making it more realistic and easier to navigate.

You can turn it off in the personalization settings if you prefer the old style.

You can also go through the cards using the arrow keys on your keyboard.

## Editor improvements

The editor has now an importing system to import existing packs.
Additionally if an editor tab is empty, it will now show an indicator that it is empty.

## Settings improvements

Backported from Butterfly, there is now a density setting to change the density of the UI. This can be useful for smaller screens or if you prefer a more compact layout.
Additionally, the scroll sensitivity can now be adjusted in the settings.
Settings can also now be imported and exported, making it easier to share your settings with others or to backup your settings.
