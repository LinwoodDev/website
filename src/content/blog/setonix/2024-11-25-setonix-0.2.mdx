Last month, I released the first version of Setonix. Today, I'm excited to announce the second big version of Setonix!

Highlights:

* üîí Cheat preventions
* üì¶ Pack downloads
* üñºÔ∏è Dialog images

## Cheat preventions

Previously when hiding a card, it was only hidden visually. Now, the card will be hidden by the server as well.
This will prevent cheating by modifing the client.

## Pack downloads

Firstly, the pack id is now generated from the sha512-256 checksum of the pack archive.
Secondly, the pack archive can now be downloaded from the server.

When connecting to a server and you don't have the packs, the server can send you the download urls for the packs.
Then you can download the packs from the kick screen and can reconnect to the server without any problems.

## Dialog images

Dialog images are now supported. You can now add images to your dialogs that appears as a banner.
This is currently only supported if you have a custom server.
