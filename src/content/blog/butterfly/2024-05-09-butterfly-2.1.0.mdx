There are two opened discussions where you can help shape the future:

- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#686](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/686) - How should the documentation look like? **(new)**
- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#627](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/627) - How should the toolbar be handled in the future?

If you have an automatic script to update Butterfly, please adjust it to the new naming of the release assets. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/568).

If you are using the nightly version, just use the last rc release. There are no changes between 2.1.0-rc.2 and 2.1.0. All nightly changes are now merged in the stable release and these are the big changes between 2.0.3 and 2.1.0.

## Shape detection

When drawing and enabling shape detection you can now draw a shape and Butterfly will detect the shape and draw it for you. This is a very useful feature if you want to draw a perfect shape but you are not very good at drawing.

## Area workflow improvements

The area workflow was improved. You can now switch with arrows between the areas and areas can now be resized and moved.

## Export improvements

You can now export the whole page with a click or switch to the current area and export it. Also you can now pin the export dialog to the toolbar for easier access.

## Waypoint reordering

You can now reorder the waypoints in the waypoint navigator just like you can with the areas. Click on the handle of a waypoint and drag it to the new position.

## Image editing

You can now invert the colors of an image or change the background color of an image. Just right click on the image and select the operation you want to apply.

## Triangle shape

With the new shape detection system a triangle shape was added.

## Native clipboard

A long requested feature is now available. You can now copy and paste between Butterfly and other apps.

## Import zip archives

You can now import zip archives. Butterfly will extract the files and add them to the page. This is useful if you have a backup of your work or want to import it.

## More customization

You can now set the toolbar size and have multiple toolbar columns. Additionally you can now set the toolbar to the top of the screen on desktop.

## Improved android file management

The file management on android was improved. You can now open files from the file manager and add a custom data directory.

## Future plans

This was a lot of progress. I will try to reduce the span between minor versions to release features more quickly.
In the 2.2 release I plan to improve the pack system, the selection system (which is currently very tricky if you have an image behind and you want to select the text above) and maybe work on the collaboration system.
A store for the packs is already planned and I will try to fit it inside this release too.
Internal changes are already in the todo list. The rendering and handler system of butterfly should be put into its own library to use it in my next game project.
Stay tuned for new updates! The first beta should arrive in the next weeks.
