There are two opened discussions where you can help shape the future:

- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#686](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/686) - How should the documentation look like? **(new)**
- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#627](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/627) - How should the toolbar be handled in the future?

If you have an automatic script to update Butterfly, please adjust it to the new naming of the release assets. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/568).

If you are using the nightly version, just use the last rc release. There are no changes between 2.1.0-rc.2 and 2.1.0. All nightly changes are now merged in the stable release and these are the big changes between 2.0.3 and 2.1.0.

## Future plans

This was a lot of progress. I will try to reduce the span between minor versions to release features more quickly.
In the 2.2 release I plan to improve the pack system, the selection system (which is currently very tricky if you have an image behind and you want to select the text above) and maybe work on the collaboration system.
A store for the packs is already planned and I will try to fit it inside this release too.
Internal changes are already in the todo list. The rendering and handler system of butterfly should be put into its own library to use it in my next game project.
Stay tuned for new updates! The first beta should arrive in the next weeks.
