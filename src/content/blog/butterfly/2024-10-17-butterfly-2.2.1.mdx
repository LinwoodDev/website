- [2.2.1-rc.1](/blog/butterfly/2.2.1-rc.1)

## Improved collection dialog

The collection dialog has been improved to a better layout and now shows the current collection.
The option to select a custom collection has been readded and a new convert to layer option has been added.

## Allow non-latin file names

> See [#743](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/743)

The file name now supports non-latin characters. Internally it was already supported, but the UI didn't allow it.

## Improved multi buttons

The input mapping now handles if multiple buttons are pressed at the same time.
It has a priority system to handle the buttons correctly.
This should also fixes some problems with stylus buttons not working correctly.

## Improved add dialog

The add dialog now has autofocus on the search bar and a transition when opening the dialog.
Additionally, it now shows a text if the search term doesn't match any tool.

Additionally the add tool icons now shows the correct icon if they are actions like undo, redo or full screen.

## Improved toolbar

The toolbar now has a size transition and the color toolbar doesn't have the full width anymore. This should make the toolbar look better and more consistent.

## Notes

This release should fix the most problems with the new layer system. After this release, I will start working on the next minor release 2.3. If you have any feature requests or bug reports, please open an issue on GitHub.
