Butterfly 2.1.1 is now available with many bug fixes.
Highlights:

- 🔄 WebDAV improvements
- 📱 Enhance mobile home page
- 🖼️ Fix images
- 📁 Fix layers

There are two opened discussions where you can help shape the future:

- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#627](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/627) - How should the toolbar be handled in the future?

## WebDAV improvements

Thanks to [@MrGumpIT](https://github.com/MrGumpIT) the WebDAV requests are now more performant and throw less errors especially when using the root folder.

## Enhance mobile home page

Butterfly now has a better mobile home page. The home page is now more responsive and looks better on mobile devices.

## Fix images

Image operations like background and invert now work as expected and the rendering now have a better quality.

## Fix layers

The layers were not rendered correctly in the past. This is now fixed and the layer visibility option is now working as expected.

## Future plans

The first butterfly 2.2 nightly builds will be available in two weeks. Stay tuned!
