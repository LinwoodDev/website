The second release candidate of Butterfly 2.2.1 is now available. This update includes a lot of bug fixes and improvements. Here are the highlights:

- ‚úèÔ∏è Improve multi buttons
- ‚ûï Improved add dialog
- üß∞ Improved toolbar

Stay tuned for next monday. There will be something big coming.

## Improved multi buttons

The input mapping now handles if multiple buttons are pressed at the same time.
It has a priority system to handle the buttons correctly.
This should also fixes some problems with stylus buttons not working correctly.

## Improved add dialog

The add dialog now has autofocus on the search bar and a transition when opening the dialog.
Additionally, it now shows a text if the search term doesn't match any tool.

## Improved toolbar

The toolbar now has a size transition and the color toolbar doesn't have the full width anymore. This should make the toolbar look better and more consistent.
