## Inverted pen support

> [#850](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/pull/850)

Previously, the inverted pen was not supported in Butterfly. This update adds support for inverted pens, allowing you to map it to a custom input.

## Select tool input mapping support

> [#821](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/821)

This update adds support for input mapping when the lasso select tool is selected. Previously, it was limited to allow right clicking on the canvas. Now, there is an advanced logic behind to only apply this when you click on the selection. Otherwise, it will use the input mapping.

## Redesigned mobile navigator page

The mobile navigator page was previously a bit buggy when using the file preview.
This update improves it by making it a dialog instead of a drawer. This allows you to use the file preview without any issues.

## Collaboration improvements

The collaboration start dialog has been redesigned to improve usability. It now has a more intuitive layout and better instructions for starting a collaboration session.

This is another step towards making collaboration stable.
