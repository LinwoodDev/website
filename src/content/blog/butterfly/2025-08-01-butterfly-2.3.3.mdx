After a releasing the second beta of Butterfly Black Hairstreak (2.4) last week, the hotfix 2.3.3 for Butterfly is now available.

Highlights:

- ü™ü Publish to Microsoft Store
- üêß AppImage builds for ARM
- üêß Snap builds
- üêß Alternative linux builds
- üîÑ Update Flutter to 3.32

## Publish to Microsoft Store

Butterfly is now available in the Microsoft Store. This allows you to install Butterfly on Windows 10 and 11 devices easily and have automatic updates.

Download it now from the [Microsoft Store](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9NB8293GBSNN).

This will become the recommended way to install Butterfly on Windows devices in the future.

I'm also working on bringing the nightly builds to the Microsoft Store, so you can help test the latest features and fixes. Stay tuned for that!

## AppImage builds for ARM

The AppImage workflow has been rebuild to improve the produced AppImages.
In the same time, ARM builds were added to the AppImage builds.

## Alternative linux builds

On debian devices, glibc has an older version than the one used to build Butterfly.
To support these older glibc versions, Butterfly had an alternative build that used a ubuntu 22.04 base image. Previously only a portable archive was available.
For this release, deb, rpm and appimage builds are now available for this alternative build.
This allows you to install Butterfly on these devices more easily.

## Snap builds

The snap builds have been fixed to work with the latest butterfly release. The snap builds were broken since the second beta of Butterfly 2.2.0.
You can now install Butterfly via snap again.

Butterfly now also supports the release channels:

* stable has the latest stable release
* candidate tracks the commits in the main branch (that will become the next stable release)
* beta tracks the latest nightly release
* edge tracks the latest commit in the develop branch (that will become the next nightly release)

The beta track currently currently has the current 2.3.3 release, but will be updated when the next nightly release is available.

## Update flutter

The flutter version has been updated to 3.32. This should improve the foundation of Butterfly to support the 2.3 release track a bit longer.

## Full changelog

* Upgrade to flutter 3.32
* Add support for arm AppImage builds
* Add more alternative linux builds
* Publish app to microsoft store
* Fix snap builds

Cherry picks:
* Fix navigator page dialogs not rounded
* Fix directory not respected when creating a document from a template

## Notes for nightly users

All fixes are already available in the nightly builds. If you are using the nightly build, you can skip this update.
