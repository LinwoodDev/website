This release contains a lot of bug fixes (inclusive many mobile bugs added in the last beta) and ui improvements.

## UI

### Redesigned navigator

The navigator was recoded to a navigation rail.
You can find all pages on the left of your screen instead of a tab view. Click on them to open the page.
It is now responsive to the rest of the ui. To disable the navigation rail, navigate to the personalisation settings of the app.
On mobile you can find all pages in the top left corner menu.

## Painters

### Hand

The hand tool has now shortcuts to select all elements on the page.
You can now cut, copy and paste your elements with the context menu or the shortcuts ctrl+x, ctrl+c and ctrl+v.
Additionally you can delete selected elements by clicking on the delete button.
A mobile problem with selecting corners was fixed.

### Asset

A new asset painter was added. To add them, click on the pin icon on the import types in the add dialog.
To add assets click in the view on any point and select your asset. The asset will appear on this position.

### Markdown

The markdown elements can now be moved.
