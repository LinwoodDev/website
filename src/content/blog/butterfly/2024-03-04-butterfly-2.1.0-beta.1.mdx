## PDF import options

Previously if you imported a PDF it was always imported with a transparent background. This makes it hard to see the content of the PDF if it has black text and you are working on a dark background. Now you can change the background color of the PDF import to white or black. Also you can invert the colors of the PDF import if you want to work in a dark mode.

## Image editing

The same options for the PDF import are now also available for images. You can now right click on an image and select the operation you want to apply.
Currently there are two operations available: Invert and Background.

## Waypoint reordering

You can now reorder the waypoints in the waypoint navigator just like you can with the areas. Click on the handle of a waypoint and drag it to the new position.
