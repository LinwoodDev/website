There are two opened discussions where you can help shape the future:

- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#686](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/686) - How should the documentation look like? **(new)**
- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#627](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/627) - How should the toolbar be handled in the future?

Don't forget that this is a beta version and there might be some bugs. Please report them on [GitHub](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues).
If you have an automatic script to update Butterfly, please adjust it to the new naming of the release assets. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/568).

## Reenable changing data directory on android

Butterfly 1.x allowed changing the data directory on android. This feature was removed in Butterfly 2.0.0 since Butterfly uses a different file system library.
This feature is now reenabled on android.

## Fix unknown import type shows euler number

This only affects the android version.
I changed the import system in the last release to support more file types.
Here I forgot to change the error message to show `Unknown import type` instead of the variable `e` which corresponds to the euler number.s

## Fix unknown import type on images

This also only affects the android version.
The new import system on android didn't recognized images as an import type (technically I checked for the exact `image/*` mime type instead of using regex). Now it should work again.

## Fix changing background removes all elements from the canvas

This affects all platforms.
When changing the background, the app removed all elements from the canvas. This is now fixed.
