After another long break, here is a new hotfix for the Butterfly beta.
Highlights:

- üöÄ WASM support
- üìÅ Change default file name
- üõ† Improve build ci

There are two opened discussions where you can help shape the future:

- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#627](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/627) - How should the toolbar be handled in the future?

## WASM support

Butterfly now uses WebAssembly on web for chromium based browsers. This should improve performance and reduce the size of the app.
Firefox is not supported due to a bug in their engine, safari currently does not support WebAssembly GC. See [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/web/wasm#chrome-119-or-later) for more information.

## Change default file name

The default file name is now the current date. This should make it easier to find files instead of empty names.

This is also a bugfix for unnamed files that got duplicated on save. Empty names should also work now without duplication.

## Improve build ci

The flutter version is now defined in the pubspec.yaml file. This should make it easier to update the version in the future and improve the general file structure.
Please update your build scripts to read from `app/pubspec.yaml` (`environment.flutter`) instead of `FLUTTER_VERSION` if you build from source.

## Full changelog

* Add wasm support for chromium based browsers
* Use date for default file name
* Fix unnamed files gets duplicated on save
* Upgrade to flutter 3.24
* Update internal component library
* Remove FLUTTER_VERSION file, use pubspec instead
