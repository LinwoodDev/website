## New features

### New property view

The property view is a new feature that allows you to view and edit properties of elements and painters. You can access it by long pressing on a painter or right-clicking on an element and click on "Properties".

You can pin the property view to keep it open when drawing with the painter.

### Enhanced color view

Colors can now be edited and removed from the color view. Additionally, you can now add new palettes, edit and remove them using the context menu in the top right corner.

### Hand, Undo and Redo are now painters

To make the UI more consistent and customizable, the hand, undo and redo buttons are now painters. You can access them by clicking on the plus button in the top right corner. You can move them around where do you want, or remove them from the toolbar if you don't want them.

### Native file opening

You can now open files (like images, PDFs and documents) directly from the file explorer. Just click on a file, and it will open in Butterfly.

This feature is only available on Windows and Linux. On Windows, you need to reinstall Butterfly to register the file type.

Additionally, images and PDFs stored in the notes directory are now shown in the file dialog and can be opened.

### Rebuilt input system

The input system has been rebuilt to be more flexible and customizable. You can now customize the painter that will be chosen when you click with your input device. The settings can be found in the settings dialog under "Behaviors".

### Minor changes

- Improve context menu (add modal background, add new scale animation)

## Notes
