## Reduce crashes during canvas movement

> [#838](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/pull/838)

This update reduces crashes during canvas movement. This was a common issue that many users experienced, and it should now be resolved.

## Docker image

The web version of Butterfly is now available as a Docker image. This makes it easier to deploy and run the application in a containerized environment.

You can find the Docker image on the [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/linwooddev/butterfly).

The documentation can be found [here](https://butterfly.linwood.dev/downloads/selfhosting).

## Android import improvements

Opening butterfly with open with intent is now working on Android. This means you can now open butterfly files directly from other applications.
