The fifth alpha of Butterfly 2.0 is now available. This release contains markdown support and a new font. Read the old 2.0 alpha posts here:

- [First alpha](/butterfly/2.0.0-alpha.0)
- [Second alpha](/butterfly/2.0.0-alpha.1)
- [Third alpha](/butterfly/2.0.0-alpha.2)
- [Fourth alpha](/butterfly/2.0.0-alpha.3)

## Markdown support

The label painter has now two modes: Text and Markdown. Markdown is a markup language that is used to format text. You can use it to format your text in the label painter. The markdown support is still in alpha and may not work as expected.

## New font

In the last alphas, we added a new font but forgot to include it in the assets. This is now fixed.
Try it out and tell us what you think about it.
