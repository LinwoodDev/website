There are one open discussions where you can help shape the future:

- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#627](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/627) - How should the toolbar be handled in the future?

## New docs

The documentation was reworked based on the discussion [#686](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/686). The new documentation is now live and you can check it out [here](https://docs.linwood.dev/butterfly/).

Some notable changes are:

* New design
* No react. This should improve the performance
* New search. This doesn't use algolia anymore and will be more privacy friendly by searching locally
* New build system. The documentation is now built with starlight. This should improve the build time.
* New languages. Because of the new build system, we can now add more languages to the documentation.
* No versioning. The documentation is now versionless. This improves the repository size and helps changing the documentation faster.
* New structure. Because of the new build system, the docs are now located in the `docs/src/content/docs` folder.

Because of the much changes, there could be some bugs. If you find any, please report them.
It would be great if you could help with the documentation by adding new pages, improving the existing ones or translating the documentation.

To create/edit the documentation, fork the repository and create a pull request with your changes.
To translate the documentation, visit the [crowdin project](https://linwood.dev/butterfly/crowdin) and start translating.

## Add hide cursor while drawing

There is now an option in the behavior settings to hide the cursor while drawing. This is off by default.

## Improve import

The pdf import performance was improved and the quality setting was reimplemented.

## Improve image rendering

For the image rendering and baked image, the quality was improved. It now uses the highest quality settings and anti-aliasing.

## Improve home page

The grid items in the home page are now centered and on mobile the home page looks better by making the view options icon buttons to be smaller.

Additionally the welcome gradient was modernized to use the secondary and primary color.

## Improve webdav

Thanks to [@MrGumpIT](https://github.com/MrGumpIT) the WebDAV requests are now more performant and throw less errors. This should improve the overall experience with WebDAV.

## Upgrade to flutter 3.22

The app was upgraded to flutter 3.22. This changes the colors and the overall look of the app.
Feel free to test the new version and report any issues you find.
