- üõ†Ô∏è Toggleable tools (Grid, Ruler)
- üîí Password protected notes
- üñºÔ∏è Import SVG as text
- üé® Updated background ui

This is the first beta version of the 2.3 nightly cycle. Stay tuned for more updates and improvements.

## Redesigned mobile home page

The mobile home page has been redesigned to use tabs for easier navigation.
This should make it easier to go to the selected view instead of scrolling through the whole page.

## Toggleable tools

Instead of having grid and ruler inside a tab in a submenu, they are now toggleable tools and can just be added like any other tool.

To toggle them, simply click on the added tool. Configure them like any other tools by long pressing on them.

They also have new properties.
The ruler now has a color property and the grid has an offset property.

## Password protected notes

To protect your notes, you can now set a password for them.
Click on the wrench icon and click on encrypt to set a password.
When opening the note, you will be asked for the password. Please note that if you forget the password, the note is lost.

You could unencrypt the note by clicking on the wrench icon and then unencrypt.

## Import SVG as text

There is now a new option in the import section to import an SVG as text.
This can be useful if you use a icon library and copy the SVG code into your clipboard.

## Updated background ui

To cleanup the wrench view, the background button has been moved to the top left corner.

Additionally you can now also set the stroke width for the pattern texture.
