## Improved custom title bar

The window buttons on the custom title bar are now in the top right corner instead of right centered. This allows you to close the window by navigating to the top right corner and clicking on the close button.

## Improved svg path export

The svg path export now exports one path for each element instead of one path for each two points and it uses the same rendering as the canvas.
Additionally the precision of the path export is now 3 instead of the full double precision.

This makes the svg export look the same as the canvas and improves the svg file size.

## File creation

There was a bug that overrided the file if the file path already exists. This is now fixed and the file creation works as expected.
