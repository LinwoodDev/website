- ▶️ Use live icons in add dialog
- 👆 Improved sensitivity settings
- 🐞 Bug fixes

Please test this release and give feedback.
The full changelog can be found below.

## Improved collection dialog

The collection dialog has been improved to a better layout and now shows the current collection.
The option to select a custom collection has been readded and a new convert to layer option has been added.

## Allow non-latin file names

> See [#743](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/743)

The file name now supports non-latin characters. Internally it was already supported, but the UI didn't allow it.

## Use live icons in add dialog

The add dialog now uses live icons for undo, redo and full screen tools.
You can now see the current state of the tool in the icon.

## Improved sensitivity settings

The sensitivity settings have been refactored to be more user friendly and more descriptive.
It now uses percent values and the minimum sensitivity of inputs has been changed to 10%.

## Bug fixes

There are several problems fixed with the new layer rendering system and the convert to layer feature.
Additionally duplicating now works correctly and the selection is updated when elements are changed.
