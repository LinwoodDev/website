The second beta for Butterfly Crimson Red (2.5) is now available!

Highlights:

- ⚡ Performance improvements
- 🖊️ Pen input experience improvements
- ⚙️ Settings and UI improvements
- 🌐 WebDAV rewrite
- 🐛 Bug fixes

## Performance improvements

Rendering performance on larger documents has been significantly improved. This includes caching paths in `PenRenderer` and `PolygonRenderer` during setup, using lightweight foreground refresh for handlers instead of full rebake, and removing redundant per-frame sorting in `ViewPainter`.
Eraser performance has also been enhanced by replacing point interpolation with line segment intersection for hit testing and caching HitCalculator instances in `PenRenderer`.
Additionally, the performance of pen hit testing has been improved.

## Pen input experience

The pen input experience has received a major update. A pen-only input toggle button now appears when a pen is detected.
The pen-only input setting is now a tri-state option: Automatic, Always on, and Always off. In automatic mode, pen-only mode is auto-enabled for the current session when a stylus is detected.

## Settings and UI improvements

The settings design has been improved for better usability.
You can now move the zoom view, and a reset zoom button has been added. The toolbar size setting has been moved to the view settings.
Also, the sync button visibility on small screens has been fixed, and autofocus has been removed from the add dialog search to prevent the virtual keyboard from popping up on mobile devices.

## WebDAV rewrite

The remote WebDAV file system has been rewritten to be more robust and reliable.

## Bug fixes

Several important bugs have been fixed in this release:

- Issues with Android intent handling causing empty documents on resume and not updating on new intent have been resolved.
- Importing assets now correctly uses the default template and selected storage.
- Fixed importing archives opening empty documents.
- Fixed spread to pages breaking PDF import and removed borders for PDF pages.
- Fixed an issue where tools sometimes lacked a unique ID.
- Fixed path eraser and eraser not working correctly if full selection is enabled.
- Fixed non-zero exit code when the app closes.
- Fixed deleting characters not working in the label tool on some keyboards on Android.
- Reintroduced white background if no background is set.

## Hotfixes from 2.4.3

This release also includes changes merged from the 2.4.3 hotfix:

- Fixed toolbar position icon direction issue on RTL layouts.
- Fixed foreground being reset if a temporary tool is added.
