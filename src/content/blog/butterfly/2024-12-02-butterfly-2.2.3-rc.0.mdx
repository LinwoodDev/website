## Toggle for color toolbar

You can now toggle the color toolbar to hide it if you don't need it. This can be useful if you want to have more space for your drawing or if you have a small screen.

## Save button indicator for autosave

There is a new setting for autosave that allows you to show a save button when autosave is active. This can be useful if you want to save manually or if you want to see the status of the autosave.

## Duplicate layer button

You can now duplicate layers with a new button in the layer panel. This will duplicate all the elements on the layer.

## Tool options panel position

The options panel can now be placed on the bottom or the top of the screen regardless how big the screen is.

## Laser tool improvements

The laser tool now has a separate duration for the laser visibility and the hide laser strokes.
Additionally there is now a new animation to remove the laser strokes called path.
