2.4 will be kept as a long-term stable version to make it as bug-free as possible. The next feature release (2.5) will take a bit longer while we focus on quality and stability.

This update will be available soon on the Play Store, Snap Store, F-Droid, and Microsoft Store.
Please report any issues on GitHub and share the app to help the project grow!

We also reached 1,600 stars on GitHub—thank you for your support!

## Performance optimizations

The app has been optimized for slower devices, usage will be faster without consuming too much memory.

* **Memory usage**: Improved memory usage when closing documents.
* **Rendering**: Faster pen tool, rendering, and tool switching.
* **Eraser**: Improved performance of the eraser and path eraser tools.
* **WebDAV**: WebDAV operations and bake queue have been optimized.

## RTL layout fixes

Previously, the RTL layout for right to left languages had many issues.
All known issues have been fixed, with additional improvements.

* Fixed appbar layout and menu opening.
* Fixed icon display issues.
* Fixed text direction in label and color toolbars.

The RTL layout wont change the ordering of the toolbars, allowing anyone to easily switch languages, without worrying about re-adapting their muscle memory.

## UI improvements

There are more UX improvements, including:

* **Add Menu**: Bigger buttons for easier interaction.
* **PDF Export**: Improved dialog layout and image export preview.
* **Navigation Rail**: It is now thinner and takes up less space.
* **Feedback**: Progress bars are shown when exporting, and a processing indicator has been added.
* **Ruler**: Added a center dot for better precision.
* **Palette**: You can now restore the current palette.
* **File Association**: Added `.tbfly` file association on Windows and iOS.

## Improved SVG Export Compatibility

The SVG export compatibility has been improved by using `fill-opacity` and `stroke-opacity` attributes.
This change enhances the compatibility of exported SVG files with various applications and web browsers.

## Bug fixes

The **main** focus of this release is to fix the issues that weren't previously.

* **Images**: Fixed issues where images would refuse to load or update (showing a gray square).
* **Export**: Fixed invisible layers being ignored on export and PDF export crashes when changing quality.
* **Input**: Fixed stylus buttons not working on some devices and improved line shape hit calculation.
* **Navigation**: Fixed smooth navigation issues.
* **Files**: Fixed renaming, duplicating, and moving files on native platforms.

## Indonesian translations

I have added support for Indonesian translation.
Thanks to the translators for helping me make this app available for a broader audience.

## What comes next?

This release was a simple patch fixing multiple issues, the next version, 2.5, will bring new features!

***But...***

This app is being developed by **only** one person, all of these feature take time and effort.

Please consider helping me by contributing to Butterfly.

You don't *need to be a programmer* to help, translating the app, improving the docs, and reporting bugs are all means of contribution that don't require programming skills.
