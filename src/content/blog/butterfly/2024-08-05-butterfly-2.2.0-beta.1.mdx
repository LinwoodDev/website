After a long break, here is a new Butterfly beta.
Highlights:

- ‚úã Left hand improvements
- üìÅ Files view improvements
- üíª Refactoring

There are two opened discussions where you can help shape the future:

- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#627](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/627) - How should the toolbar be handled in the future?

## Left hand improvements

The navigator can now be positioned to the right. This is useful for left handed users. You can change the position in the settings.

## Files view improvements

The files view now has a basic multi file selection. You can now select multiple files and delete them. There is more to come in the future.

Additionally the list and the grid view now has a more responsive design. Renaming now also looks better.

## Refactoring

The file system was refactored to include it as a library. This will make it easier to use the file system in other projects (see Current state).

## Current state

In the 2.2 release I also want to address the current state of layers. The layers in the current version are not as powerful as in other drawing applications. I want to change that and create a new layer system that allows changing the render order of layers and more.
This also means, that these won't be compatible with the current layers. Because of this, I will rename the current layers to "groups" and the new layers will be called "layers".

A more detailed explanation can be found in the issue [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#728](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/728).

The update cycle will be a bit slower in the future, because I'm working on a new project called [Quokka](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Quokka/discussions/26). Stay tuned for more information.
