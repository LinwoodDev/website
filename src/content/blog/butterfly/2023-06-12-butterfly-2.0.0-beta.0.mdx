## Navigation bar

The navigation bar is a new feature in Butterfly 2.0. It is a bar at the left side of the window that contains many useful features:

* Waypoints
* Layers
* Pages
* Files

Waypoints are previously there as painters. They are now moved to the navigation bar. Waypoints are a way to navigate in your document. You can create waypoints and jump to them. This can be useful if you have a big document and want to navigate to a specific part of it.
Layers was already available in Butterfly 1.0 but not in the redesign of Butterfly 2.0. We added it back in this release.
Pages is a new feature that allows you to create multiple pages in one document. This can help you to organize your document better. Painters and tool options will be shared between all pages.
The files section allows you to quickly change between your documents. You can also create new documents from there.

## Painters

I recoded the area painter and it now allows you to create areas inside of other areas.
Additionally toolbars have now dynamic sizes. With this the color toolbar is now smaller while the other toolbars have the same size as before.
Some painters now have an outline. This is an indicator that you can change to them with the shortcut feature that you can change in the behavior settings.
