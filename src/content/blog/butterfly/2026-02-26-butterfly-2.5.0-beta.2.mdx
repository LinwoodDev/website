The third beta for Butterfly Crimson Red (2.5) is now available!

Highlights:

- 🗺️ Area improvements
- 🧠 Memory leak fixes
- 📁 File management improvements
- 🐛 Bug fixes

Additionally flutter has been upgraded to 3.41 in this release, which should bring some performance improvements and bug fixes as well.

Please note that some features on the roadmap for 2.5 have been moved to 2.6 to ensure the release can be released in a reasonable time frame.

## Area improvements

This release brings significant improvements to areas. You can now open an area as the initial view and create an initial area when creating a document inside the template dialog. If no areas exist, an area creation dialog is now available in the area navigator.
Additionally, area teleportation has been added after entering an area, and other areas are now shown if you are inside an area. The bottom bar in the area and page navigator has also been improved.

## Memory leak fixes

We have addressed several memory leaks in this release to improve the overall stability and performance of the app. These fixes cover various areas, including the PDF and SVG renderers, importing elements, baking the viewport, the concurrent asset system, document closing, undoing and loading documents, and elements changed and removed events.

## File management improvements

> [#942](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/942)

You now have the option to hide file extensions. When importing documents, the import file name is now used as the default name, and you can now import multiple files at once.

## Bug fixes

Several important bugs have been fixed in this release:

- Fixed file extension being hidden if the file name is too long.
- Fixed area teleporting having an offset on render resolutions other than fast.
- Fixed handwriting, suggestions, and emoji input not working for text fields.
- Fixed spacing of the pen-only toggle if the zoom view is disabled.
- Fixed importing a file inside a subdirectory having unexpected behavior.
