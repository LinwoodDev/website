Please test this version and report any issues you find.
This version gets released as stable version next week if no major issues are found.

There is one open discussion about the web version of the app, feel free to take part in the discussion: [#767](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/767).

## GitHub achievements

We hit 1100 stars on GitHub and reached 4000 commits.

Thank you for your support and feedback.

## Template dialog improvements

Handling with templates is now much easier. You can now override tools more easily, found the details of a template faster and duplicate templates to create new ones.

## Color wheel

The color picker now has a color wheel to select colors more easily.
You can now select the color by clicking in the wheel and adjust the brightness in the slider below.

Additionally the slider thumb are now colored in red, green and blue to preview the selected value.

## Render resolution

To improve scrolling and moving on the canvas, there is now a setting render resolution.
By the default it renders 1.5x times the size of the viewport but you can put it on performance to have the previous behavior and render only the size of the viewport. There is also the option best to render double the size.
Feel free to give feedback to this new feature.

## Search redesign

The search interface now looks like material 3 and shows the results more clearly.
Tools now has a default name and an icon.
Additionally it is restricted to 10 results to have a better overview.

## Slider improvements

The exact slider now has a better responsiveness behavior and on medium displays it now renders the title and text field in one line and the slider below.
This should match the behavior of the other apps better.
