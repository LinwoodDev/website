## Painters

In this beta release of Butterfly 2.0, several exciting features have been introduced to enhance the painting experience. Let's take a closer look at the changes related to painters:

### Custom Mouse Cursors for Painters

Working with different painting tools is now more intuitive, thanks to the addition of custom mouse cursors for painters. 
Each painting tool now has its own cursor icon, making it easier to what you can do with it. ([#426](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/426))

### Spacer Painter

With the new spacer painter, you can add empty spaces or gaps within your creations.
This is useful for people who want to write text or draw something in a specific place that are already filled with other elements.

### Full-Screen Painter

Addressing user feedback, the full-screen painter has been introduced in this beta release.
This feature allows easier switching between the full screen mode and the normal mode. ([#432](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/432))

### Recoded Hand Tool

The hand tool has been recoded to enable real-time transformations, allowing users to manipulate and adjust elements on the canvas with greater fluidity.
You can now transform elements in real time.
All the transformations were moved out of the context menu into the view.

## UI

In Butterfly 2.0's fifth beta release, significant improvements have been made to the user interface, enhancing usability and overall aesthetics. Let's explore the UI-related updates in more detail:

### Floating Toolbar

Instead of a big toolbar, the toolbar space is now responsive from the contents in it. If the toolbar is small enough, you can see the canvas on the remaining space. ([#445](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/445))

### Settings Animation and Blur

The beta release introduces animation and blur effects to the settings panel, adding a touch of visual polish to the overall experience.

### Responsive Main View UI

With the goal of providing a seamless experience across different screen sizes, the main view UI is now more responsive.
If you select the pen painter the zoom view moves up if the toolbar is not on top.
The window title bar has been improved to provide a more intuitive experience. The title bar now only allows dragging the window when the cursor is on a free space, making it easier to interact with the window controls.
