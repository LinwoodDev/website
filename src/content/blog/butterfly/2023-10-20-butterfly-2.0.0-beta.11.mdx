## Printing

Printing directly from Butterfly is now possible. It uses pdf as export format and the default printer of your system. You can also select the areas you want to print.
Additionally the pdf export option now uses the current view as default page.

## File browser

The file browser is now faster. The files will be shown as soon as they are loaded instead of waiting for all files to be loaded. This is especially useful for large directories.
