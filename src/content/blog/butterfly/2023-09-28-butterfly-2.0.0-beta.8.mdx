The property view now has a transition when the height changes.
When changing the tool, the bottom arrow now smoothly appears.
Additionally the open animation of the search dialog has been improved.
If you now open the utilities, you will now see that this button is selected.
All selected icon buttons now use the fill variant.

The old tools property view has been replaced with a new document properties view.
Many options were moved into new tabs. There are now tabs for: Document, Page, View and Camera.
