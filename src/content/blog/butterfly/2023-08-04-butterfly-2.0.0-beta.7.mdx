We have polished many features for a better user experience.

## Painter

On all painters you can now use `ctrl+a` to open the hand painter and select all.

### Pen

You can now customize the icon of the painter. To do this open the property view of this painter and click on the icon.
This change is only visually for the property view and the toolbar.

### Stamp

You can now scale the stamp and can use ctrl and shift to scale from center or keep the aspect ratio. The stamp painter now has a toolbar to make this easier to find your component easier.

## UI

Moving and zooming can now be locked using the lock button in the toolbar.

Additionally you can find a new component tab in the navigator. This tab shows all components of packs and you can paste them easily into your document.
Components have a thumbnail now to make it easier to find the right one.

The waypoint and layer tab can now be used to rename.
Renaming of things in the app is now possible by double clicking on the name.

## Settings

On android you can now change the data directory. This is useful if you want to use a sd card or wants to sync the data directory with a cloud service.
For this to work the app needs to have the permission to write to external storage.
When pasting an image the scale of it will be determined by the image scale setting and your screen.
