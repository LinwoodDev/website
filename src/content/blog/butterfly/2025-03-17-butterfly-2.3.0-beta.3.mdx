## Add file preview to files navigator

> [#736](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/736)

You can now preview files in the files navigator by clicking on them.
This will open now a read-only document viewer.

## Option to import and export settings

You can now import and export your settings.
This should make it easier to share your settings between devices or with other users.

## Inline property name editing

> [#797](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/797)

You can now edit names inside the title bar by clicking on them.
Previously every tool had a name field which could be confusing and take up space.
