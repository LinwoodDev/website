There is one open discussion about the web version of the app, feel free to take part in the discussion: [#767](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/767).

Additionally there is a new discussion about a new file format to support git: [#770](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/770).

## More interface customization

You can now toggle the color toolbar to hide it if you don't need it. This can be useful if you want to have more space for your drawing or if you have a small screen.

Additionally the options panel can now be placed on the bottom or the top of the screen regardless how big the screen is.

## Save button indicator for autosave

There is a new setting for autosave that allows you to show a save button when autosave is active. This can be useful if you want to save manually or if you want to see the status of the autosave.

## Laser tool improvements

The laser tool now has a separate duration for the laser visibility and the hide laser strokes.
Additionally there is now a new animation to remove the laser strokes called path.

## Template dialog improvements

Handling with templates is now much easier. You can now override tools more easily, found the details of a template faster and duplicate templates to create new ones.

## Color wheel

The color picker now has a color wheel to select colors more easily.
You can now select the color by clicking in the wheel and adjust the brightness in the slider below.

Additionally the slider thumb are now colored in red, green and blue to preview the selected value.

## Render resolution

To improve scrolling and moving on the canvas, there is now a setting render resolution.
By the default it renders 1.5x times the size of the viewport but you can put it on performance to have the previous behavior and render only the size of the viewport. There is also the option best to render double the size.
Feel free to give feedback to this new feature.
