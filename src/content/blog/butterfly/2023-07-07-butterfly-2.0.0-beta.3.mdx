This release contains a lot of bug fixes and ui improvements.

## UI

The UI has been improved a lot. The toolbar is now customizable and you can change the position of it.
The title text field is now smaller too.
Additionally the delete painter has been removed.
Instead you can now delete elements with the delete button in the properties or move the painter to the right of the add button.

A new pages button has been added to the toolbar. It allows you to switch between pages and add new pages quickly.
You won't be asked for a name when adding a new page. Instead you can now change the page name in the navigator.

Full screen mode has been improved too. It is now a real full screen mode and not just a maximized window.
The appbar is now hidden in full screen mode.

## Background

You can now add a background image to your document.
The scale can be changed in the new properties tab in the background dialog.
