## Add indicator for scale proportion

> [#616](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/616)

A new indicator has been added to the scale tool to show if the scale is proportional. This should help new users to understand the functionality better.

## Multiple background + svg background support

> [#778](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/778)

You can now add multiple backgrounds to your document.
The file format supported this previously, but the app doesn't support it until now. Now you can layer multiple backgrounds on top of each other (if you have a transparent background).

Additionally, you can now use svg files as a background.

## New image operations

> [#794](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/794)

Image operations should help changing image easy without the need of an external editor.
You can now flip images horizontally, vertically and change them to grayscale.

## Reworked add dialog

The add dialog has been reworked to make it easier to use.
In every release, new tools are added and the dialog was getting bigger and bigger.
This update now adds filters to the dialog to make it easier to find the tool you are looking for.

## Improved grid and ruler tool

The grid and ruler tool has been improved in many ways.
They now work with most of the tools and the grid now has a new option to make them position and zoom dependent.

## Draw from center in shape tool

> [#800](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/800)

Previously the shape tool had keyboard shortcuts to draw proportional and draw from center. There was no way to use it without the keyboard on a mobile device.
This update adds a new setting to the shape tool to draw from the center.

Additionally the old keyboard shortcuts now toggle the setting instead of conflicting with the aspect ratio setting in the tool.

## Improved hit calculations

> [#799](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/799)

The hit calculations have been improved in many tools.
Previously the hit calculations were not working correctly in some cases.
This lead to unexpected behavior when using the selection tool.

This update fixes the hit calculations for shapes like circles, lines, rectangles and triangles.

## Improved template dialog

The template dialog has been improved to make it easier to use.
You can now select all and deselect all templates with a single click.
Additionally the create button has been changed to a floating action button to make it consistent with the rest of the app.

## Notes

This was the biggest beta release in the history of Butterfly and work from multiple months. Please test everything and report any issues you find.
The next beta will probably take a bit longer since I'm currently not finished with studying and have to focus on that.
However, I will try to release a hotfix if there are any critical issues.

Thank you for your support and have fun with the new features.
