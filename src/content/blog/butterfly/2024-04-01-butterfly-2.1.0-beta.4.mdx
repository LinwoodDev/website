## Enhanced area user experience

The areas navigator page now supports auto creating areas and navigating between them. This makes it easier to create areas and navigate between them. Additionally you can now switch areas more easily.

## More UI customizability

You can now have multiple toolbar columns and set the toolbar size in the settings. This makes it easier to customize the UI to your liking.
Additionally you will find a pointer test in the behavior settings to test if the app detects your pointer correctly.
