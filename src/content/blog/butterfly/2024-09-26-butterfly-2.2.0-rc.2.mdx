Being so close to the 2.2 stable release, I forgot to add the new layer system to the baking system. This release candidate fixes that and adds the ability to convert a collection or a selection to a layer.

## Full changelog

* Rebuild baking system to support multiple layers
* Add convert to layer to collection dialog
* Add convert to layer to general area context menu
* Fix layer ordering being reversed
* Fix current layer not being changed
* Fix lock collection mode not working
* Fix elements being modifyable in different layers
* Fix invisible layers setting being ignored
