## Layer merging

The main feature of this release is layer merging. You can now merge layers to one layer. This is useful if you want to combine multiple layers into one.
This should complete the basic layer feature for now. If you have any feedback or feature requests, please open an issue on GitHub.

## Right click context menu

To allow easier navigation on desktop, you can now open context menus with right click on the desktop or long press on mobile.
This should match the behavior of other applications and make it easier to use Butterfly.
