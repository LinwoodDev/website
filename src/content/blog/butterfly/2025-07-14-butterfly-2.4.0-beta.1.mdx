After a month, the second beta release of Butterfly Black Hairstreak (2.4.0-beta.1) is here with many new features and improvements!

Highlights:

- 🖌️ New polygon tool and element
- 📏 Stroke width in toolbar
- 📦 Pack renaming improvements

## New polygon tool and element

> [#399](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/399)

With the new polygon tool, you can now create custom polygons in your documents. This tool allows you to create polygons with any number of sides, making it a good choice for creating complex designs.

Please test this tool and give feedback on its usability and functionality.

## Stroke width in toolbar

> [#797](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/797)

The toolbar now includes a stroke width option, allowing you to easily adjust the stroke width of elements in your document without having to open the properties dialog.

## Pack renaming improvements

Pack item renaming was removed in the last beta release and readded in this release. Additionally, you can now rename components in the pack dialog which was not possible before. This should improve the usability of the pack system.

## Notes

The new 2.4 release is still in working and I'm working on creating a new hotfix release for the 2.3 version.
