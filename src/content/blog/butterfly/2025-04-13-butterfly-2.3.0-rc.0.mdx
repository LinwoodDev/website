Thanks to [@chriscavalluzzi](https://github.com/chriscavalluzzi) for contributing to this release!

## Lock layer

The lock layer option allows you to restrict editing to the current layer. This is useful for preventing accidental edits to other layers while working on a specific layer.
You can enable this option in the lock menu on the toolbar.

## File navigator improvements

The current file navigator has been improved to use the parent directory of the opened document as the initial path. This makes it easier to navigate to related files without having to manually search for them.

Additionally, a bug was fixed that caused the current opened document not to be highlighted in the file navigator.

## Collaboration improvements

I'm also continue working on collaboration improvements in this update.
You can now add a custom user name for collaboration, which will be used to identify you in the collaboration session.
Additionally the collaboration button was moved in the top left corner menu and disconnecting from a collaboration session will now be visualized.

## Bug fixes

On tablet devices, the layout has changed when opening the keyboard, which made it impossible to edit text in the navigation rail. This update fixes this issue.
Additionally, the scroll sensitivity was improved and the thumbnail capture now uses the current viewport.
