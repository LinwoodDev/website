## 3rd anniversity

24th November 2020, Butterfly had [the first commit](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/commit/c60351115cdac4941c041f9e774e45bffb5258a8). After that I worked on Butterfly for 3 years. I want to thank all contributors and users for their support.
Initially I built butterfly for working in the school. Then covid-19 came and I used butterfly for my online lessons.
Now we are here, 3 years later and butterfly is still in development. I hope you enjoy using butterfly as much as I do.
This release is a big step towards the final release of Butterfly 2.0. This is the last beta release before the first release candidate.

## Experimental features

This release adds experimental features. You can enable them in the settings. These features are not stable and may contain bugs. If you find a bug, please report it on [GitHub](https://linwood.dev/butterfly/report).

### Collaboration

This was a long requested feature. Now you can collaborate with other users on the same document. This works by using websockets.
To use this feature, you need to enable it in the settings. After that you can open a document and see a share button in the title bar. Click on it and then on start.
To join this session, the other user needs to click on the connect button in the plus menu in the home page. Then he needs to enter the url of the session (for example `ws://localhost`). After that he can join the session.

## Importer

### Xopp

This is another long requested feature: Importing xopp files. Xopp is a file format used by Xournal++. Not all features are supported yet, but most of them are. Try it out and report bugs if you find some.

### Pdf

The pdf importer now supports spread. This means that you can import every pdf page in a separate page in butterfly.
