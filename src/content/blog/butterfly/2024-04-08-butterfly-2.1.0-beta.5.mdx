## Native clipboard

Butterfly now supports the native clipboard. You can copy images from your system clipboard and paste them into Butterfly.

## Import zip archives

You can now import zip archives into Butterfly. This makes it easier to import multiple files at once.

For example if you backup your Butterfly files you can now import them back into Butterfly.

## Improve temporary tools

In the last versions some tools handled the secondary mouse button themselfs and doesn't allow using them as temporary tools. This is now fixed and you can now use every tool as temporary tool.

Additionally temporary tools will be changed if there isn't any touch devices interacting and you touch the screen at the first time.

Please report if you have other tools that doesn't work as temporary tools.

## More customizing

You can now set the toolbar size to small, tiny or compact. This makes it easier to customize the UI to your liking.
Additionally there are new density settings named maximize and desktop.

These settings allow you to maximize the canvas when you have a mouse connected.

## Platform specific android apks

Butterfly now has platform specific android apks. This means that you can now download an apk for your specific architecture.
This makes the download smaller and faster.
The universal apk is still the recommended one if you don't know which architecture your device has.

## Fix pressure path rendering

Previously the app simulates the pressure always regardless of the input.
Now it checks the values and only start simulating if every pressure value is 0.
The fix should also change existing documents.
