## Fix triangle rendering

The last release introduced a new manual triangle shape. Previously the triangle didn't get sized correctly. This is now fixed.

## Fix temporary tool

In the last releases the temporary tool was changed to support select tool and more. To do this, the tool wasn't removed when the pointer gets released.
The problem was that the tool was still active when using a not configured input. This is now fixed.

## Fix select all

The select all feature was broken a long time ago. It's now finally fixed.

## Fix import error

The last release introduced more import intents for android. The problem was that the import system still assumed that the file is a `.bfly` file. This is now fixed.

## Full changelog

* Fix triangle rendering
* Fix temporary tool won't be removed when using not configured input
