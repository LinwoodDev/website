## Line shape detection

The line shape detection is a new feature that allows you to draw a line with the pen tool and Butterfly will detect it and convert it to a straight line. This is useful if you want to draw a straight line but you are not able to do it perfectly.
To enable it open the properties of the pen tool and enable the Shape Detection option.
There is more to come in the future like shape detection for circles and rectangles.

## Area

The area tool got some improvements. You can now resize and move the area with the new controls by tapping on it.
Also there is now a new area navigator page where you can see all your areas, reorder and edit them.

## Export

The export system also got some improvements. You can now export the whole page by clicking on the file icon in the png and svg export dialog.
When clicking on the new pin icon in the dialog title bar you can pin it to the toolbar for easier access.
