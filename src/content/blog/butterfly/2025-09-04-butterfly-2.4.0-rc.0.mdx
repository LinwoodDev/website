- 🐞 Bug fixes

## Support for math in rich text

> Finished [#725](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/725)

You can now add math formulas to rich text elements using LaTeX syntax by clicking on the math button in the toolbar.
This was first added in [2.4.0-beta.2](/butterfly/2.4.0-beta.2) for markdown elements and is now also available for rich text elements.

## Better PDF import

The PDF import was reworked and now supports custom import names for the imported pages.
This will be used as prefix for the areas and pages created from the imported PDF.
For example you can choose `My PDF` as import name and the created pages will be named `My PDF 1`, `My PDF 2`, etc.

## Improved page naming

The default page name has changed inside the templates to be an empty name. This will be shown inside the app in your localization as `Untitled` or similar instead of showing always `default`.

For this to work you need to reset your templates to the new defaults or changing the page name to an empty name manually.

## Bug fixes

This release includes many bug fixes and improvements.
Latex rendering was fixed and the rendered math is now centered.

Additionally, some UI issues were fixed, like the home page header not being aligned properly and having wrong colors.
Templates are now editable in the template dialog again.
More over UI fixes were done in the page navigator and navigator rail to look better on screens with notches and transparent navigation bars.
Pixel ratio not being saved when unbaking the viewport was also fixed. This means that elements won't look pixelated anymore after erasing elements.
These were also bugs being there for a long time and now finally fixed.

## Notes

Butterfly Black Hairstreak (2.4) is now feature completed and won't get any new big features anymore.
Please test this release candidate and report any bugs you find.
If no major bugs are found, the final 2.4.0 release will be available this month.
