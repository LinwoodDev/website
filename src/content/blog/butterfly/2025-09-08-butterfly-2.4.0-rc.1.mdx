The second release candidate of Butterfly Black Hairstreak (2.4) is now available with hotfixes.

Highlights:

- 🧪 Add temporary toolbar
- ⚡ Optimize page events
- ✏️ Update stroke rendering
- 🐞 Bug fixes

## Add temporary toolbar

> [#900](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/900)

There is now an option in the settings to make the simple toolbars (like color toolbar) temporary visible. If you start drawing, the toolbar will disappear.

## Optimize page events

Previously, pdf import and other operations that created many pages at once caused a lot of events to be created and processed. This could lead to performance issues and slowdowns.
Now, these operations are optimized to create and process events at once, improving performance and responsiveness.

## Update stroke rendering

The stroke drawing algorithm dependency has been updated to improve the appearance and quality of hand-drawn strokes.
This should make strokes look smoother and more natural on sharp curves.

## Bug fixes

Some bugs were fixed in this release.
Loading overlay had problems that it could not be closed and pdf spread pages imports not being optimized were fixed.

## Notes

Butterfly Black Hairstreak (2.4) is now feature completed and won't get any new big features anymore.
Please test this release candidate and report any bugs you find.
If no major bugs are found, the final 2.4.0 release will be available this month.
