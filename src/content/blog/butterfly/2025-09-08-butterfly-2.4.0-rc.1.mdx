The second release candidate of Butterfly Black Hairstreak (2.4) is now available with hotfixes.

Highlights:

- ‚ö° Optimize page events
- ‚úèÔ∏è Update stroke rendering
- üêû Bug fixes

## Optimize page events

Previously, pdf import and other operations that created many pages at once caused a lot of events to be created and processed. This could lead to performance issues and slowdowns.
Now, these operations are optimized to create and process events at once, improving performance and responsiveness.

## Update stroke rendering

The stroke drawing algorithm dependency has been updated to improve the appearance and quality of hand-drawn strokes.
This should make strokes look smoother and more natural on sharp curves.

## Bug fixes

Some bugs were fixed in this release.
Loading overlay had problems that it could not be closed and pdf spread pages imports not being optimized were fixed.

## Notes

Butterfly Black Hairstreak (2.4) is now feature completed and won't get any new big features anymore.
Please test this release candidate and report any bugs you find.
If no major bugs are found, the final 2.4.0 release will be available this month.

## Full changelog

* Optimize pages events
* Update stroke drawing algorithm
* Improve stroke width controls in color toolbar
* Fix loading overlay having error on multiple closes
* Fix pdf spread pages import not being optimized
