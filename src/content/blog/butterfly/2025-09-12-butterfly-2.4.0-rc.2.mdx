The third release candidate of Butterfly Black Hairstreak (2.4) is now available with hotfixes.

Highlights:

- ü§ñ Restoration support on Android
- ‚ö° Performance improvements
- üêû Viewport bug fixes
- üì¶ Android binaries changes

## Restoration support on Android

When Butterfly is killed in the background on Android, it will now restore to the last opened state instead of starting a new session.

## Performance improvements

Removing elements performance has been improved, especially when removing many elements at once.

## Viewport bug fixes

The previous on-demand rendering had some issues where images and pdfs were not rendered when the viewport was set up.
This has been fixed and should work correctly now.
Additionally sometimes renderers were duplicated when baking, this has also been fixed.

## Android binaries changes

The legacy apk build has been added to have an option to have a smaller binary size. Read more in the [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/build/releases/past-releases/agp-4-2-0-release-notes#compress-native-libs-dsl). If you don't need smaller download sizes, it is recommended to use the default apk build.

Also support for 16kb page size has been added on Android. This means it should run better for x64 devices.
