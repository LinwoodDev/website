Highlights:

- 📄 Rework PDF system
- 🔄 Improved rotation based scaling
- ⬆️ Flutter upgrade and Android min version bump to 7.0 (Nougat)
- 🐞 Bug and performance fixes

## Search bar in waypoint view

To help finding waypoints in large documents, there is now a search bar in the waypoint view.

## Rework PDF system

Instead of converting PDF pages to images on import, there is now a dedicated PDF element. This should improve the quality of the imported PDFs and allow to edit the PDF elements in the future.

Additionally this should improve the performance and file size of loading documents with many PDF pages.

Already existing PDF elements remain unchanged.

## Improved rotation based scaling

> [#518](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/518)

The rotation based scaling was improved. This is not finished and there will be more improvements in the future.

## Version upgrades

Flutter was upgraded to 3.35. This includes many performance improvements and bug fixes.

Additionally the minimum Android version was increased from 6.0 (Marshmallow) to 7.0 (Nougat) since Flutter 3.35 requires this.
