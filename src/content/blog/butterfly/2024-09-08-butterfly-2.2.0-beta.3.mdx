Another week another beta release. This time with some new features and improvements.
Stay tuned for the next weeks with a new big feature for Butterfly.
After that I will try to release the final version of Butterfly 2.2.
Highlights:

- ðŸ”§ Full selection mode
- ðŸ›  Save utilities states after restart

Quokka will be released next month. I will try to post some more information about it in the next weeks.

## Full selection mode

The full selection mode allows you to select elements only if the selection area is fully covering the element. This is useful if you have many elements on top of each other and you only want to select a specific one.

## Save utilities states after restart

The utilities states are now saved after a restart (lock state, ruler state and the new full selection mode). This should make it easier to continue working where you left off.

## Full changelog

* Add full selection mode
* Save utilities states after restart
* Ignore invalid files with invalid syntax
* Fix elements not being selected after moving
* Fix file gets duplicated on save (again)
* Fix image background wrong offset when moving on canvas
* Fix packs dialog showing templates
* Fix web showing no templates on first start
* Fix templates and packs gets overriden on creation with same name
