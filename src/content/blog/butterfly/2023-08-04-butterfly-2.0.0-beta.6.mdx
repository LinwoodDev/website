Please note that this is still a beta release and may contain bugs. If you find a bug, please report it on [GitHub](https://linwood.dev/butterfly/report).

We have multiple new features and many bug fixed including performance improvements on the homepage on mobile.

## Page

You can now sort pages and create pages on the selected position.

## Painter

### Move

There is now a new move painter. With this you can freely move on the page without any extra features like with the hand painter.

### Hand

If you transform your selection, it won't be deselected anymore after that.

### Shape

The shape painter was recoded to allow keybindings like shift and ctrl to center or keep the aspect ratio.
