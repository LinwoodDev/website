## UI

The classic theme can now be selected in the settings. On desktop and mobile this wasn't possible before because it used the system colors.

Additionally the top left corner menu now has an indicator if it is opened or not.

The secondary color of the classic theme has been changed to red to make it look better.

The last beta release had a bug where the tabs were not aligned correctly. This is now fixed.

## Tools

The spacer tool is now realtime. This means that you can see the changes while dragging.
