## Improved print/pdf export

The print/pdf export dialog now supports multiple pages and the dialog was improved in general to look better and be more user friendly. You can now move the area selection left and right and add all areas at once.
Additionally, the dialog now shows the page name and you can filter for the current page only when adding areas.

## Improved search

The search now searches the whole document instead of only the current page and search in the current tools.
Moreover, the search dialog now has a shortcut (ctrl + k) to open it.

## Improved shape detection

The shape detection now uses a library to detect shapes and supports rectangle, triangle and circle.
Turn the shape detection on in the pen tool properties and draw a shape to see it in action.

Currently it doesn't work on firefox but we are working on a fix.

Thanks to [@MrGumpIT](https://github.com/MrGumpIT) for the contribution!

## Smooth navigation

There is a new experiment in the settings to enable smooth navigation. This will make the camera decelerate slowly when you stop moving it. This is useful for touch screens and makes it feel more natural.

Enable it in the settings under Experiments and let me know what you think.

## Other improvements

In the pages navigator page you can now rename the current page.
You can now set the toolbar size in the settings to make it bigger (useful for touch screens).
The quickstart now has an advance button to configure the templates.

Internally the events are now run synchronously instead of asynchronously to remove bugs when running events at the same time. Additionally the events now use element keys instead of indexes to remove bugs when multiple events are fired at the same time.
