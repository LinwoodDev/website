After a week with a hotfix, here is a new beta with big changes and improvements.

Highlights:

- ‚öôÔ∏è Improved document settings
- üîç Add search bar for components navigator page
- üñ•Ô∏è Binary changes (New linux arm, min Android version 6.0)
- üêõ Many bug fixes

## Improved document settings

The document settings have been improved to make it easier to use.
There are now only two tabs: General and Camera.
The background button has been moved to the top left corner to make it easier to access.
Inside the general tab, the name field has been removed and the description field only changes on submit. The name field is already on the top and causes confusion.

## Add search bar for components navigator page

The components navigator page now has a search bar to make it easier to find the component you are looking for. The pack selection has been moved to the right of the input field.

## Binary changes

The linux arm binaries have been added to the release. Please test them and report any issues.

The minimum version of android has been changed to 6.0 (Marshmallow) instead of 5.0 (Lollipop). See [the discussion](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/780) for more information.

## Many bug fixes

There were also big bug fixes in the release. A few were added from the latest hotfix.

Additionally thanks to [@timkrief](https://github.com/timkrief) the pen strokes now should look better if they have a big stroke width.

Moreover the collaboration system was broken in the last releases. This has been fixed and should work now. Additionally it should now have a better performance when joining a room.
