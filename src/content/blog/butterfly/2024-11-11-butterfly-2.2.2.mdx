Butterfly 2.2.2 was released with important improvements and many bug fixes.

Highlights:

- ðŸ“‚ Layer merging
- ðŸš© Right click context menu
- ðŸ’¾ Improve save performance

## Layer merging

The main feature of this release is layer merging. You can now merge layers to one layer. This is useful if you want to combine multiple layers into one.
This should complete the basic layer feature for now. If you have any feedback or feature requests, please open an issue on GitHub.

## Right click context menu

To allow easier navigation on desktop, you can now open context menus with right click on the desktop or long press on mobile.
This should match the behavior of other applications and make it easier to use Butterfly.

## Improve save performance

> [#667](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/issues/667)

Saving large pages should now be faster. This should make it easier to work with large pages and save them faster.
It's not perfect yet and also needs some more work.

## Changes since last nightly

There have been some bug fixes that were not included in the nightly builds:

* Fix loading screen showing after error
* Fix packs dialog file system operations
* Downgrade pdfjs on web

Other than that, the changes are the same as the last nightly build.
The next nightly build will include these changes.
