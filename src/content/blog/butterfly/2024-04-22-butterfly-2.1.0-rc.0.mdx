## Image background svg support

Image background support was added in 2.0.0-beta.3 but had no svg function for it.
Now it was added by using the pattern feature in svg.

## A new triangle shape

The triangle shape was added in 2.0.0-beta.3 too but only to be used in the shape detection in the pen tool.
Now you can find the triangle shape in the shape tool and in the add dialog.

## Templates improvements

The templates dialog was redesigned and now supports overriding the tools for selected templates. Additionally if you add a new template you can now give it a name.

## New android open with intents

You can now open zip, pdf and images with Butterfly on android by opening the file with Butterfly. Previously you can only open `.bfly` files.
