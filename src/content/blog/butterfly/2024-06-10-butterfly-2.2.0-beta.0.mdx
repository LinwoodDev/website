The first Butterfly 2.2 beta is available. This release is a bit smaller than usual but still contains some nice improvements and fixes. The next beta will contain more features and improvements and will share libraries with my upcoming project [Quokka](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Quokka).
Highlights:

- üßΩ Eraser enhancements
- üîí Lock layer
- üìÅ Pack UI improvements

There are two opened discussions where you can help shape the future:

- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#627](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/627) - How should the toolbar be handled in the future?

## Eraser enhancements

The eraser tool now has a new switch to erase elements. This allows you to disallow the eraser to erase other elements than paths. The normal eraser now also has a shape element to erase shapes. This allows erasing shapes that were created with the shape detection.

## Lock layer

You can now lock layers. This prevents you from accidentally removing elements from a different layer.

## Pack UI improvements

The local tab was renamed to installed to better reflect the content. You can also install packs from this tab with a single click.
