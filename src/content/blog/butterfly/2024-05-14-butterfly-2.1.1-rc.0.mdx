After a big release, there are always some bugs that need to be fixed. This is the first release candidate for the 2.1.1 release.
Highlights:

- üîÑ WebDAV improvements
- üì± Enhance mobile home page
- üñºÔ∏è Fix image editing
- üìÅ Fix layers

There are two opened discussions where you can help shape the future:

- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#686](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/686) - How should the documentation look like? **(new)**
- [LinwoodDev/Butterfly#627](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Butterfly/discussions/627) - How should the toolbar be handled in the future?

## WebDAV improvements

Thanks to [@MrGumpIT](https://github.com/MrGumpIT) the WebDAV requests are now more performant and throw less errors. This should improve the overall experience with WebDAV.
There is another pull request open that will be merged in the next release that will improve the WebDAV experience even more.

## Enhance mobile home page

The old mobile home page was very big and you need to scroll a lot. Now the mobile home page is more compact and you can see more at once.

## Fix image editing

There was a bug in the image editing that caused the image to not change. This is now fixed.

## Fix layers
