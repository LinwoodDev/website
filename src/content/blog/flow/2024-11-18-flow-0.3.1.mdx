After half a year of development, Linwood Flow 0.3 was released!
This update brings many new features, a new app foundation and many bug fixes.

Highlights:

- üé® New icon
- üö© Right click context menu
- üìÅ Update repository

## New icon

To have a more modern look and a better readablity, the icon was updated. This also includes a new themed icon on android.
It also updates the classic theme colors from purple to blue.
Feel free to give feedback on the new icon.

## Right click context menu

Ported from Butterfly, Flow now has a right click context menu. This should make it easier to navigate the app on desktop.

## Update repository

Also ported from Butterfly, the project setup was updated. This should make it easier to work on the project and make it more consistent with other Linwood apps.
This includes adding a checksum file to the releases, updating many dependencies and updating flutter to 3.24.
