Linwood Flow 0.2 was released!
This is the second big release of Linwood Flow. It adds a lot of new features and fixes a lot of bugs.

## Dashboard

The dashboard has now links to all displayed cards. This makes it easier to navigate to the right place.

## Remotes

There is now a new ical remote storage. This allows you to sync your data with any ical compatible server.
It reads the content of the ical url and converts it to the internal format. This format does not allow you to write back to the server.

## UI

You can now set the start of the week in the settings.
Additionally the weekdays are now displayed in the list view and the calendar view has now a large layout.
To have consistent icons across all linwood apps the icons are now phosphor icons.

## Notes

The app is work in progress and not production ready.
Please report any bugs or feature request on [github](https://github.com/LinwoodDev/Flow).
