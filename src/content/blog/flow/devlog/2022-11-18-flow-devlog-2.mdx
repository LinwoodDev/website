![Flow Devlog 2](2.png)

Welcome to the second devlog of Flow!
Click [here](/flow/devlog/1) to read the first devlog.

## Events

Events can now have a status (draft, confirmed and canceled)
and can be filtered by status in the event list. The event list also shows the status of the event.
Additionally, the calendar list now has an infinite scroll.

## To-dos

Events can now have to-dos. To-dos can be added to an event and can be marked as done.
There is an extra page for to-dos where you can see all your to-dos and filter them by status.

## Groups

Basic group functionality is now implemented. You can create groups, edit them and delete them.
Currently, it shows all events associated with the group, but currently there is no way to add events to a group.

## Web Preview

You can preview the app in your browser by clicking [here](https://flow-rcbp8apcj-linwood.vercel.apps).
Please note that the app is in development and the database schema may change in the future.
That means that you may lose your data when the app is updated. Use it only for testing.

## Animations

The sidebar is now persistent when changing pages in desktop mode.
This helps to keep the context of the page you are currently on.
