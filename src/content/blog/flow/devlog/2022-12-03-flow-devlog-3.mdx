Welcome to the third devlog of Flow!
Click [here](/flow/devlog/1) to read the first devlog.

## Teams

All functionality of the teams was moved to the groups.

## Events

Events can now be assigned to groups.
Additionally, new filters were added to the calendar: `Group`, `Place`. A new `Past` filter was added to the calendar to show past events.
More over, the calendar is now responsive and has a new look on the desktop.

## To-dos

To-dos can now be created without an event. Click on the fab button to create a to-do. If a to-do has no event assigned, you will see a button to create a new event or assign an existing one.

Additionally, to-dos has now three states: `Todo`, `In Progress`, `Done`. You can change the state by clicking on the checkbox.
In the future there will be a karbon board with rows for each state.
Filters for all states were added to the to-dos page. A new search button was added to the to-dos page to search for to-dos.

## Users and Places

Basic functionality of the users and places was added. You can now create users, query them and delete them.

## Groups

Event groups are now called groups. You can create groups, query them and delete them. Additionally, you can assign events to groups.

## UI-Improvements

The filter ui was replaced with chips. This follows the material design guidelines.
Additionally, the page transitions were improved to a fade in/out animation.
Another improvement is the new intro slides. They are now more informative and show the most important features of Flow.

## Web Preview

You can preview the app in your browser by clicking [here](https://flow-l4vpzboz6-linwood.vercel.app).
Please note that the app is in development and the database schema may change in the future.
That means that you may lose your data when the app is updated. Use it only for testing.

## Animations

The sidebar is now persistent when changing pages in desktop mode.
This helps to keep the context of the page you are currently on.

## Notes

The readme was updated to have more information about the app and include a link to the devlog.
