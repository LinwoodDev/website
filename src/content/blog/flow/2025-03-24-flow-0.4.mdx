Highlights:

- üë• User/Group System
- üìÅ Replace places with resources
- ‚öíÔ∏è Modernize project setup (ARM Linux binaries)

## User/Group System

To prepare for a proper server system, the user and group system was reworked. Multiple users and groups can now be added to events and calendar items as owners. Users can also be part of multiple groups.
Try it out and give feedback.

## Replace places with resources

Places were an idea to allow managing book times but were not flexible enough. They were replaced with resources. Resources can be anything and can be added to events and they can also have multiple resources. They can also have multiple owners.

## Modernize project setup

Because of the long time between updates, the project setup was outdated. This was modernized to the latest standards based on the Butterfly project. For example, arm linux binaries are now available.
