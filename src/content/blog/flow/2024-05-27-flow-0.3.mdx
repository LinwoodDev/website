üé® UI improvements
üöÄ App foundation updates

## Changed release assets

Butterfly 2.1.0 changed the release assets naming. These changes were applied to Flow 0.3.

## Dashboard update

The dashboard now shows a clock. This makes it easier to see the current time.
Additionally, the dashboard is now the back page. This makes it easier to navigate the app.

## Notebooks

You can now create notebooks and group notes in them. This makes it easier to organize your notes.
With this the child notes are now in the right drawer instead of the bottom.

## Simplify group/place creation

The group and place creation can now be done in the event creation dialog. This makes it easier to group your events.

## UI improvements

I have applied changes from Butterfly to Flow. This includes a density setting, high contrast mode, classic theme and the custom title bar where the close button is now in the real top right corner.
Additionally, the icon style for different calendar item types was improved. The material 3 colors of chips were improved as well.
On mobile the dialogs were very small. This was fixed by making them full screen on mobile.
