Linwood Flow 0.1 was released!
The app should solve all problems regarding time, event and todo planning that convential calendar apps do not solve.
Currently you can save your data using caldav or local but there will be more in the future.
The docs are currently work in progress. Try the app out yourself and help improving it if you want.
You can find the app in the play store as open test or using the download page on the docs website: https://docs.flow.linwood.dev/downloads
A request in the fdroid issue tracker was created and a flatpak version will come soon.
