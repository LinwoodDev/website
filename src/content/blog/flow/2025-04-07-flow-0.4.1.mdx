- 🐛 Bug fixes

## Unify settings dialog with other linwood apps

Linwood Flow had always a different settings page than the other linwood apps similar to the one on chromium. This was changed to be more consistent with the other apps. The settings page now looks like the one in Butterfly and has the same features.

## Improve dashboard design

The dashboard was slightly changed to have consistent spacing and be more responsive.

## Use linking instead of creating inside details tab views

The details tab views previously only allows to create new items. Adding new items was not possible. This was changed to be default to linking and inside the select dialog you can create new items.
