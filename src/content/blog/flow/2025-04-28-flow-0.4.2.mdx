Flow 0.4 had broken some things and was not working correctly. This release fixes those issues and adds some new features.

Highlights:

- üîó Finish linking entity system
- üõ†Ô∏è Improve settings
- üîÑ Rework paging system to a built in solution
- üêõ Bug fixes

## Finish linking entity system

In the last hotfix, linking was used instead of creating inside the relations tab views. This was now expanded to all entity types. You can now link to users, groups, resources and events. This should make it easier to manage relations between entities without creating new ones.

## Improve settings

Butterfly had improvements to the settings dialog like importing and exporting settings. This was now added to Flow. You can now import and export settings to a file. This should make it easier to transfer settings between devices.

Additionally, a density personalization option was added. This allows you to change the density of the app. This is useful for devices with small screens or if you want to have more space between items.
This is similar to the density option in Butterfly.

## Rework paging system to a built in solution

The previous paging system was not working correctly and was really hard to use. This was changed to a built in solution. This should make it easier to work in the future and more reliable for the user.
